# Release catalog exploration

## Notes

Work in Marek's active AM fork, on main-marek. Goal: find a simple reliable approach, evolve it through experiments, then propose it upstream. This map and tickets are intentionally tracked by Git.

Earlier work: [2026-10-20 design and measurements](../../design/version-catalog.md), with throwaway code on proto/release-catalog in tools/proto-catalog/. Preserve that branch and its evidence. The earlier design combines a GraphQL collector, CI version selection, and a generic installer. The newer direction separates upstream observations from app-specific selection and leaves selection on the client. Neither is immutable policy.

## Decisions-so-far

- [01: prior research reconciled](issues/01-reconcile-prior-work.md): retain useful measurements, but distinguish the earlier resolved catalog from the current observation catalog. The reported 825-point sweep is GraphQL evidence, not a REST response-catalog capacity measurement.
- Working direction: collector preserves upstream metadata without ranking releases or selecting downloads; app scripts keep policy. Public upstream metadata is not independent binary authenticity.
- Explore a dedicated AM publication branch, hourly collection, reviewed endpoint inventory, retained observations on temporary failures, per-observation checked times, explicit stale-data acceptance beyond 24 hours, and selective client downloads pinned to a publication commit.
- Raw GitHub response snapshots are the initial compatibility hypothesis. Reconsider format and endpoint strategy based on measurements and reuse needs. Exact-response compatibility and efficient GraphQL batching may conflict.
- Catalog work does not execute the active app installer or installed updaters. Existing app management behavior remains unchanged during experiments.

## Fog

- [06: manual REST churn experiment](issues/06-manual-rest-churn-experiment.md): prepared and awaiting separately authorized observations; long-term quota behavior and fleet storage remain unmeasured.
- [04 resolved](issues/04-compare-collection-strategies.md): REST-first experiment agreed; revisit the representation if churn/storage evidence or future consumer needs justify it.
- Retention and Git growth; volatile response fields; large asset lists; removed upstream data; standalone updater migration; actual publishing privilege separation; eventual upstream preferences.

## Progress

2026-10-27: read prior design and prototype source without checking out the prototype branch. Prepared a bounded sh/curl/jq workflow-token probe, using only read permissions and retaining public responses and quota headers as a seven-day Actions artifact. Default branch on GitHub is main while live development is main-marek, so the probe also has a narrowly scoped main-marek push trigger. Publishing/running requires the approved push; no schedule is enabled.

2026-10-27: fc0e2be7d pushed to origin/main-marek with Marek's approval. Probe did not appear in run/check listings or the public workflow registry. [Ticket 02](issues/02-workflow-token-probe.md) is open with ready-for-human triage pending a signed-in Actions configuration check. No runtime quota measurements yet.

2026-10-27 correction: gh works with keyring access outside the sandbox. It confirmed Actions is disabled repository-wide (enabled=false), while the five existing workflows are individually active. Marek requires manual-only experiments. Removed the probe push trigger and added a manual-event job guard; keep repository Actions disabled pending an approved isolation/registration plan. Earlier push-trigger and signed-in-browser suggestions are superseded.

2026-10-27: [03 resolved](issues/03-inventory-release-requests.md), with [measured inventory](research/request-inventory-findings.md): 8,337 literal release URLs, 164 unresolved dynamic occurrences, 1,559 shared URLs across architectures. Daily polling averages 347.4 REST calls/hour before overhead, so a full hourly sweep is not required by the 24-hour target. Existing classifier counts reproduced. Prepared local one-file registration commit 43cceedf7 without checking out or merging main. [05](issues/05-isolate-and-register-manual-probe.md) records the proposed isolation/enablement plan; all Actions settings remain unchanged.

2026-10-27: with Marek's explicit approval, changed fork default to main-marek via gh. GitHub immediately registered Catalog quota probe (398162689). This supersedes the main-branch stub plan; main was not modified. Actions remains disabled, and no experiment was dispatched. Updated [05](issues/05-isolate-and-register-manual-probe.md) with the remaining isolation/enablement steps.

2026-10-27: [05 resolved](issues/05-isolate-and-register-manual-probe.md). Disabled all five unrelated workflows, verified isolation while Actions was off, then enabled Actions and verified the probe is the sole active workflow and there are no pending runs. No experiment dispatched. [02](issues/02-workflow-token-probe.md) is ready for an explicitly authorized manual run.

2026-10-27: [02 resolved](issues/02-workflow-token-probe.md). Authorized run 40496182929 succeeded: real token reads public upstreams, REST 304 did not increase usage, small GraphQL batch cost 1, and both budgets reported 5,000/hour for that run. Final /rate_limit GraphQL counters disagreed with direct GraphQL response evidence; recorded without speculating. [Findings and persistent evidence](research/probe-run-40496182929-findings.md). No extra run; unrelated workflows remain disabled. [04](issues/04-compare-collection-strategies.md) is now unblocked.

2026-10-27: [04 claimed](issues/04-compare-collection-strategies.md); [strategy comparison](research/collection-strategy-comparison.md) records matched-coverage payload measurements, compatibility limits and a proposed three-observation manual REST churn experiment. Awaiting Marek's design decision; no run or push authorized.

2026-10-27: [04 resolved](issues/04-compare-collection-strategies.md) after Marek accepted REST-first measurement. Prepared bounded collection, offline storage/Git/filter diagnostics and manual choices in the existing probe workflow; seven fixture tests and workflow shell/YAML checks pass. [06](issues/06-manual-rest-churn-experiment.md) tracks separately authorized observations and result interpretation. No push or experiment run.

2026-10-27: approved push through 6f9648bb2 and exactly one baseline dispatch. [06 partial result](research/churn-baseline-40499617203-findings.md): run 40499617203 stopped on WezTerm HTTP 301 after four successful responses. Evidence retained; incomplete baseline cannot seed repeats. No further dispatch.

2026-10-27: [redirect investigation](research/wezterm-redirect-investigation.md) captured GitHub's repository-ID destination in one separate public GET. Prepared explicit sample URL and bounded error evidence retention, with eight fixture tests passing; automatic redirects remain disabled. No target read, push or replacement baseline.

2026-10-27: [replacement baseline succeeded](research/churn-baseline-40500475496-findings.md), run 40500475496 at 13:01 Europe/Warsaw, source 37bdb433c. Six HTTP 200 responses; 4.88 MB exact versus 0.62 MB diagnostic body totals. Evidence preserved; next is separately authorized churn-hour with previous_run=40500475496. No churn claim or automatic follow-up.
